# iDrive
iDrive is a project that encompases creating a website where an individual can login,create an account either with the email or social media account , order for a driver to drive them home in their own cars and pay for the service fee online . iDrive is an app, mostly for people who own cars. iDrive is innovative and it is alligned with the SDGs because it will help reduce traffic in urban roads and the eason for this is because i think peple will prefer being driven in their own cars rather than ordering an uber or a taxi. idrive is an idea that i think will come in handy for alot of pople because it boosts convinience,helps save time and most of all,brings comfort.
